Well [React Conf](https://conf.reactjs.org) is officially over. There were a lot of great talks, human beings, activities, and of course food. I'm still digesting the whole event but, as far as conferences go, this has been the best one I've attended so far.

The developer community can often be intimidating. The volunteers and organizers did an incredible job making everyone at the conference feel welcome. I was impressed at the lengths they went to make us all feel like we belonged. There were even some _introvert activities_ on the second day. Have you ever painted a minifigure (think [Warhammer](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Warhammer)) at a conference? I have now! So for all those involved, thanks!

This post is going to be a reflection of _some_ of my favourite React Conf takeaways. Every single talk was worth watching, so I recommend you check out the recordings for [day one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxoX2faIgDQ) and [day two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDDxR1a15Yo). You might be surprised by some of the items on the list. I was too! Not everything is technical but there is a common thread weaving throughout.

# Developer Experience In Service of User Exeperience

# Concurrent Mode, React Core, and Relay

# CSS-in-JS-at-FB

# Data-Driven JavaScript

# Solving World Hunger

# Making REST Feel Better (and Safe)

# Under React's Hood (Building a Custom Renderer)

# Localization (t's Important!)

# The Accessiblity Marathon

# You Don't Need Redux (Right?)

# Why Today Is Like 1999

# Even Dev Tools Are About UX

# Suspenseful Data (Relay is Awesome)

# React is Fiction

# UX-Driven Fluid Animations

# Iterating on Real Experiences

# The Complexity of Simple Things

# Beautiful Transparency

# Wonder-Driven Development

As I mentioned before, these are just a _few of my takeaways_. There were many libraries, techniques, and philosophical ideas shared throughout the two day conference. I wish I could have captured them all! If you go next year you'll know what I mean.

If you'd like me to expand on any of these ideas I'd be more than willing to. Reach out and let me know!

Finally, thanks to all the [amazing speakers who talked this year](https://conf.reactjs.org/speakers.html)!
